# Team charter

The team charter is dynamic following the conda governance policy, with the following caveats:

- 🧰 The team’s purpose is to develop and maintain code included in the conda/installer repository. That repository contains among other things tools and scripts to make it incredible easy to create and maintain installers similar to the current “miniconda” or “miniforge” installers.

- 📨 The team acknowledges the need for better coordination between stakeholders that work on installers and bootstrappers in the conda community.

- 📢 To enable accountability and predictability towards end users, the team commits to open and transparent communication about the release process, whenever possible.

- ♻️ The team will abstract code shared between the various installers in the ecosystem in a central location to reduce diverging implementations.
